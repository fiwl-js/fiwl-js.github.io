Quickstart boilerplate is already provided on a github repository. To use that, please follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your bash environment**<br/> MacOS and Linux users can continue to the next step. If you are Windows user, using WSL is highly recommended because Command Prompt and Powershell are quite different. Thus, potential problem is high on future development. There is an [official WSL installation tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to follow. For Windows 8.1 or older, use [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) instead.
2. **Clone via git**<br/> For installing quickstart boilerplate, just clone via git with this command:<br/> `git clone https://github.com/Thor-x86/fiwl-quickstart`
3. **Start your favorite IDE**<br/> Now you can choose `fiwl-quickstart` as project directory for your [IDE](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-an-ide). If you are using VSCode, enter this command:<br/> `code ./fiwl-quickstart`

When the IDE shown correctly, let's start learning on the [next page](/docs/how_to_use).
